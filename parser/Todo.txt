Variables can all reserve a full 8 bytes
Functions and strings can point to their corresponding memory

For now functions cannot be converter to variables and vice versa





Serialize vm code and labels. with comrpression
Add proper string type with length and data functions
Write a function for reading from files
compile a glshader
Add proper AOT mode, all constants/globals can be stored in code. malloc for new objects at runtime
Add diff patching of code
Add support for bitflags |
AcceptInput(XboxController | Keyboard)


//done
Add support for loops and branches
Add input and window classes

Compile multiple functions and classes at once, get functions and put in vm.
When compiling multiple functions or classes, make sure to compile with no inline so we get all the functions. A second optimizing pass can be done after that compiles as inlined. This way we can call functions from new functions.

To get label positions, will have to preprocess all modules first

func1: pos 1000
 1

func2: pos 1500
 1
